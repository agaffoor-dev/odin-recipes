<h3>Description</h3>

  <p>
    To create a mouthwatering lasagna, start with freshly made pasta sheets, either homemade or store-bought, boiled until al dente. Meanwhile, prepare a rich, meaty Bolognese sauce by gently sautéing onions, garlic, and ground beef in olive oil until browned. Season generously with salt, pepper, and a hint of dried oregano, then stir in tomato paste and crushed tomatoes, allowing the flavors to meld over low heat. In a separate bowl, combine creamy ricotta cheese with grated Parmesan, chopped fresh basil, and a pinch of nutmeg for a luscious cheese layer.

    Now, assemble the lasagna in a deep baking dish, starting with a ladle of Bolognese sauce to coat the bottom. Layer pasta sheets over the sauce, followed by dollops of the ricotta mixture and a sprinkling of shredded mozzarella. Repeat these layers until the dish is filled, finishing with a generous layer of mozzarella on top. Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden, about 45 minutes. Let it rest briefly before slicing into squares of hearty, cheesy goodness, each bite revealing layers of tender pasta, savory meat sauce, and creamy cheese—a perfect blend of textures and flavors that will satisfy any appetite.
