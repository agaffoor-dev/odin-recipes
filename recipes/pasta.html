<h3>Description</h3>

  <p>
    To create a comforting Alfredo pasta dish, begin by cooking fettuccine noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water until they are al dente. While the pasta cooks, prepare the sauce by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant, being careful not to brown. Pour in heavy cream, stirring constantly, and bring to a gentle simmer. Gradually sprinkle in grated Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth and velvety.

    Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg for added depth of flavor. Drain the pasta, reserving a small amount of pasta water, and toss it directly into the Alfredo sauce. Stir well to coat the pasta evenly. Serve hot, garnished with freshly chopped parsley and an additional sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if desired. This dish offers a luxurious blend of creamy textures and savory flavors, perfect for a cozy dinner at home.
